### If its not a priority queue, its a trie
They are pronounced like Tree (its named after Re"trie"val Tree).  So its a
Trie tree (but people keep calling them try trees / prefix / digital tree)!
These happen SO frequently in interviews, its outstanding!  For the sake of
being practical, lets go over them.

### The trie
The easiest way to visualize a trie is to think of auto-complete.  Lets go over
it on the whiteboard!

### Lets not implement one!
I like using the whiteboard from time to time because i don't have to prove
that I write amazing code all the time.
