### There is this common saying about interviews
Just use a hash map

### What are maps?
its too easy to think of `{}` or `new Map()` and just assume we know them.  The
reality is that we know how to use them, most of the time we don't actually
know they work.

<br/>
<br/>

(we wont demistify `{}`, those are different data structures than a hash map)

### Terms
load factor:  The amount of data points vs the amount of storage (`data.len / storage.capacity`)<br/>
key: a value that is hashable and is used to look up data.  The hash has to be consistent.<br/>
value: a value that is associated with a key<br/>
collision: when 2 keys map to the same cell.<br/>

### Lets whiteboard what is happening
* Insertion
* Deletion
* Collisions
* Running Time
