### Real talk
How many of you are now interested in using vim after seeing that sweet sweet
coconut oil'd experience?

<br/>
<br/>

Don't lie to me...

### What's next?
Shockingly, most of the "data structures" of computer science, but few of the
algorithms.

<br/>
<br/>

In other words, what's next other than the entire world?

* Tons of graph data structures
* exotic tree algorithms
* implementing anything in Rust
* using (neo)vim

### For now
Vim on and prosper
