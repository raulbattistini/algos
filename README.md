# Algorithms and Data Structures in TypeScript

Each folder has a specific goal, i.e `kata-machine` has its own `README` as well because it's being done throughout a FrontEnd Masters course.

Playground is meant to be a place to test my solutions to LeetCode problems and document solutions I may find.

Of course TS is not the best language to implement such things, as Java, C and C++ are more suitable ones for this goal. But it'll be kept the way it is for now.
