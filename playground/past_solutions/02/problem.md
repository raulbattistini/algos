# [2. Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

# Solution
As the Medium author says, it is quite easy to come up with a brute force solution (as I did too). But to have a decent runtime as this code implements is hard.
