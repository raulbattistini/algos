# [7. Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/)
Given a signed 32-bit integer `x`, return `x` with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range `[-231, 231 - 1]`, then return `0`.

Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

# Solution
An intuitive and readable solution with great runtime and memory usage. From the submissions tab itself.
