# [4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/)
Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

The overall run time complexity should be `O(log (m+n))`.

# Solution
It's quite easy to solve it with a time complexity of O(m+n). \
Code presenting it in a clean manner.
