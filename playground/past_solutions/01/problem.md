# [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

# Solution
As for other cases, it is also easy to brute force this problem. But again performance would not be great. This approach wasn't intuitive at all to me, so I found nice.
