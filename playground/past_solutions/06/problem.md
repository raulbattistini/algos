# [6. Zigzag Conversion](https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/)

The string `"PAYPALISHIRING"` is written in a zigzag pattern on a given number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a fixed font for better legibility)
And then read line by line: `"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"`

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a number of rows. Examples:
1. Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 3\
Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"\
2. Input: s = "PAYPALISHIRING", numRows = 4\
Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"\
3. Input: s = "A", numRows = 1\
Output: "A"

# Solution
An elegant solution and also one of the fastest runtimes (beats 98%).
